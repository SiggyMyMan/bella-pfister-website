			<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is Bella Pfister and I am from Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally born in Guatemala, but was adopted at 4 months old to come to Cincinnati. I am a seventeen year old girl who started photography three years ago. I always had a passion for taking pictures of others and realizing their beauty on the inside and outside. This first started out as a hobby, but now it has become more to me. It is a way to express my creativity and my feelings through my work and to help others realize their beauty too.</p>
